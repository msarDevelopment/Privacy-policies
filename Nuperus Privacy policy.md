Nuperus Privacy policy

Last updated: November 16, 2022

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed Nuperus to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (channels, their links and articles) created by the you (the user) is stored locally on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Please be aware that as Nuperus continues to develop I may update this Privacy policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app handles your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
